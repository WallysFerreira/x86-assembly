# SUB instruction

The _sub_ works similarly to the _add_ instruction, except it subtracts from the register instead of adding to it.

It's form is ```sub <register1>,<value or register2>```

The result of the subtraction is stored at ```<register1>```

The sub instruction can generate a negative value, in this case the Sign Flag (SF) will be set.
